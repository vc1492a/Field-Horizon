## Field Horizon
The sun is our most precious resource. It's also a resource most of us take for granted. 4.6 billion years old, our sun has seeded our world with life by providing light and heat for everything on Earth. Our sun also showers our world with bursts of color, day after day, year after year. On Monday, October 3rd 2016, students from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Northwestern University came together to record color and luminosity of the sunrise from five locations on the Chicago lake shore. This project is a representation of what we saw that day, and can be viewed [here](https://vc1492a.github.io/Field-Horizon/). 

### Chicago Sunrise Data

This project was designed and inspired by a dataset that contains colors and brightness levels recorded during a sunrise in Chicago on October 3rd, 2016. Brightness was recorded as luminosity (lux), with the colors of the sky and the water recorded as RGB values. Color names are also included for a large portion of the dataset. The dataset was collected as part of a joint class between the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Northwestern University called Data as Art. The dataset is available [from this Github repository](https://github.com/vc1492a/Chicago-Sunrise-Data).

### Device Compatibility
This website and demonstration was built in the span of a few hours and is likely not to work well on a broad range of devices at this point. However, it's a work in progress.
